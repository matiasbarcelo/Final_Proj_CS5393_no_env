He can marry him to Gatehouse Ami in Lancels place. Seven save us all. His aunt gave a sigh. And speaking of the Seven, why would Cersei permit the Faith to arm again? Jaime shrugged. I am certain she had reasons. Reasons? Lady Genna made a rude noise. They had best be good reasons. The Swords and Stars troubled even the Targaryens. The Conqueror himself tread carefully with the Faith, so they would not oppose him. And when Aegon died and the lords rose up against his sons, both orders were in the thick of that rebellion. The more pious lords supported them, and many of the smallfolk. King Maegor finally had to put a bounty on them. He paid a dragon for the head of any unrepentant Warriors Son, and a silver stag for the scalp of a Poor Fellow, if I recall my history. Thousands were slain, but nigh as many still roamed the realm, defiant, until the Iron Throne slew Maegor and King Jaehaerys agreed to pardon all those who would set aside their swords. Id forgotten most of that, Jaime confessed. You and your sister both. She took another swallow of her wine. \"\n",
